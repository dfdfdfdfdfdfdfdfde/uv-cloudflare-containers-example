   cd uv-cloudflare-containers-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Use `pip` to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` as a reference.

1. **Build the Docker Image**
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-fastapi-app .
   ```

2. **Push to Cloudflare**
